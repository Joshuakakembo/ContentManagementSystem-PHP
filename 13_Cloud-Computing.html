<header class="page-header" style="padding: 0px 0px 9px; margin: 40px 0px 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238);"><h1 class="page-title" style="padding: 0px; margin: 20px 0px 10px; line-height: 1.1;">Cloud Computing</h1></header><div class="entry-content" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">IT networks normally have a server located in your office which contains data and files. Connected to this server will be users’ individual computers with software programs loaded on them such as Microsoft Word and Excel.</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">With cloud computing the servers are in data centers with everything accessed over the internet rather than via programs loaded on individual computers.</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Hostalite ltd provides cloud computing services via our dedicated data centre in Manassas Virginia.</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">The main benefits to using cloud computing are that remote working becomes easier, a wide range of additional services becomes available, robust business continuity and disaster recovery options can be created, and it may free-up office space as dedicated servers might not be needed.</p><h3 style="padding: 0px; margin: 20px 0px 10px; line-height: 1.1;"><b>Who Can Benefit from Cloud Computing</b></h3><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Anyone, depending on how it is used.</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">It can be used as an entire organization-wide IT solution, but we generally find that’s more suitable for smaller start-ups who would like an all-inclusive, fixed-price package without expensive up-front capital costs or who are likely to expand quickly.</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Most other users benefit from selecting the applications best suited to their needs.</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">In addition, it may cost less than a traditional IT solution, but not always. The main cost benefits include:</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Potentially lower running costs as the server space is shared – you pay only for what you need.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Reduced capital costs as lower-spec equipment can be used in the office.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Lower maintenance costs as engineers do not need to visit your office as often</p><h3 style="padding: 0px; margin: 20px 0px 10px; line-height: 1.1;"><b>What we Provide</b></h3><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">We find that some types of services are more suited to cloud computing than others so we will happily advise on whether a cloud-computing or traditional IT set-up is best for your needs.</p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">The cloud computing services available from our selves include:</p><ul style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px; list-style: outside none none;"><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><b>Virtual Desktops</b> – this allows you to access information on the server from wherever you are, e.g. using a laptop in a coffee shop or whilst out on the road.</li></ul><ul style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px; list-style: outside none none;"><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><b>Hosted Services</b> – remotely host applications used by the whole organization, rather than using your own server space for applications. This reduces server space and makes maintenance easier.</li></ul><ul style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px; list-style: outside none none;"><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><b>Hosted Email</b> – similar to the above but specifically for email services, allowing employees to access their email wherever they are on any device, including smart phones.</li></ul><ul style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px; list-style: outside none none;"><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><b>Offsite and Remote Back-up</b> – routines can be created to conduct back-ups automatically at the end of every day, so you aren’t reliant on someone remembering to do it correctly. Data is stored securely away from the server and computers in case anything should happen that would prevent access to the office, which also allows quick recovery to key documents if needed, such as for insurance purposes.</li></ul><ul style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px; list-style: outside none none;"><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><b>Email Continuity</b> – this mirrors your email service on an ongoing basis so that if access to email is lost, it can be continued as if nothing had happened whilst the cause is investigated and normal email facilities are restored.</li></ul><ul style="padding: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px; list-style: outside none none;"><li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><b>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</b> – the cloud can play a very important role in ensuring that the impact of any disasters is minimized and that your business is back up and running as soon as possible.</li></ul><div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden; height: 1px;"><a href="https://typemyessays.com/essay-writing-services" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; transition: all 1s ease-in-out 0s;">https://typemyessays.com/essay-writing-services</a></div></div>
